📊 Machine Learning Internship Tasks
Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Project Repository 🚀
This repo contains the solutions to four real-world machine learning tasks completed during my internship. Each task demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
📌 Tasks Overview
🔹 Task 1 – Student Performance Prediction
Objective: Predict student performance (pass/fail) using demographic, social, and academic features.
Dataset: Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Data preprocessing & feature encoding
Logistic Regression classifier
Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix visualization
Outcome: Identified factors influencing student success and built a classification pipeline.
🔹 Task 2 – Customer Segmentation
Objective: Segment customers into meaningful groups based on spending and income.
Dataset: Mall Customer Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Data preprocessing & scaling
K-Means Clustering
Elbow method & silhouette score for optimal clusters
Visualization of customer segments
Outcome: Discovered distinct customer groups to support targeted marketing strategies.
🔹 Task 3 – Loan Approval Prediction (Level 2, Task 4)
Objective: Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data.
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Data cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values
Logistic Regression vs Decision Tree Classifier
Confusion Matrix evaluation for both models
Outcome: Built and compared models to understand approval patterns and key factors.
🔹 Task 4 – Sales Forecasting (Level 3, Task 7)
Objective: Forecast Walmart weekly sales using historical time series data.
Dataset: Walmart Weekly Sales Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Feature engineering (Year, Month, Week extraction)
Random Forest Regressor with RandomizedSearchCV tuning
Evaluation using MAE & RMSE
Visualization of Actual vs Predicted sales
Outcome: Built a forecasting model to predict sales trends with tuned tree-based methods.
