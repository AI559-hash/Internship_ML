📊 Machine Learning Internship Tasks
Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Project Repository 🚀.
This repo contains the solutions to the internship tasks provided by Elevvo . Each task demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, machine learning models, evaluation, and visualization in Python (using Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code).
📌 Tasks Overview
🔹 Task 1 – Student Performance Prediction
Objective: Predict student performance (pass/fail) using demographic, social, and academic attributes.
Dataset: Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Logistic Regression classifier
Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix visualization
Outcome: A baseline classification model to understand factors influencing student scores.
🔹 Task 2 – Loan Approval Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information.
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier
Performance evaluation with Confusion Matrix
Outcome: A classification pipeline that assists in understanding loan approval patterns.
🔹 Task 3 (Level 2) – Loan Approval Prediction (Extended)
Objective: Improve loan approval prediction with additional model comparisons.
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Logistic Regression vs Decision Tree comparison
Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
Confusion Matrix visualization
Outcome: Comparative study of models to determine the most effective approach for predicting loan approvals.
🔹 Task 4 (Level 3) – Sales Forecasting
Objective: Forecast Walmart weekly sales using historical time series data.
Dataset: Walmart Weekly Sales Dataset (Kaggle)
Approach:
Feature engineering (Year, Month, Week extraction)
Random Forest Regressor with RandomizedSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
Performance evaluation with MAE & RMSE
Visualization of Actual vs Predicted sales trends
Outcome: A forecasting model capable of predicting weekly sales patterns with tree-based regressors.
